# nest-starter
A project to teach myself [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/). It uses the [Sakila example database](https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila) to model a video store.

When complete, this will have both the NestJS backend and a React frontend.

## Backend query language
The backend will use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for a query language because I want some more experience with that too. :D
